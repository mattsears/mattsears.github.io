Writing multi-threaded code is hard. If you've ever done concurrent programming, you'll *probably* agree. Clojure offers a compelling alternative to traditional object-oriented approaches to programming and has garnered much attention from the Ruby communities because of it's elegant design that lets you get right to the essence of a problem.

What is Clojure?
----

Simply put, Clojure is a functional programming language for the Java Virtual Machine with several powerful features for building concurrent applications. In addition, Clojure is fast, robust, and a powerful general-purpose programming language. A dialect of Lisp, Clojure embraces traditional code-as-data philosophy and a powerful macro system, plus some syntactic sugar tailored to Java.

Now that [version 1.0](http://clojure.blogspot.com/2009/05/clojure-10.html) is out and Stuart Halloway's new book [Programming Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure) just dropped, I've rounded up some of the best articles and tutorials on Clojure to you get you up to speed quickly.
