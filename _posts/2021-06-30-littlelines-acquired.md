It's my great pleasure to announce that [Littlelines](https://littlelines.com)
has been acquired! It's a great pleasure because the future is even more bright
for Littlelines.

When I started Littlelines fourteen years ago, I set out to create a consulting
firm that truly focused on client's success in a safe space where the team could
grow professionally and enjoy the work at the same time. I truly believed and _still_
believe that success doesn't mean we have to sacrifice our home life,
quality of work, or sanity - just the opposite it fact. <!--more--> At it's heart,
Littlelines is a place to collaborate on products in a fun and nurturing
environment.

We didn't always get it right and there were certainly ups and downs, but it was
okay to make mistakes as long as we learned from them. As a result, the business
grew way beyond what I could have ever imagined. The company profits grew ever year,
team members moved on to become CTO's, senior product designers, and community
leaders paving the way for new tools and technologies for the next generation of
software development.

I'm very proud of the work we've accomplished over the years and I cherish the
relationships I've formed with clients and teamates from all over the
world. I've worked with the some of the best people anyone could ask for.

#### What's the future hold for Littlelines?

In a nutshell, Littlelines is in the best position to continue the great service
it has come to be known for. I have worked with the new owners for the past few
months as a full-time employee and I'm more hopeful about the company's future
than ever. One remarkable thing about this change is just how little is actually
changing - same great mission, same great service. The goal will be the same as
it's always been: to foster team development and provide exceptional service for
it's clients.

As for me, I've learned an incredible amount over the past fourteen years in
business, engineering and leadership. After building hundreds of software
products for small businesses, large enterprises, and non-profits, I've had
fortunate opportunity to observe what it takes to build successful products and
grow them into a viable businesses.

I'm a creator at heart. It's been a life-long journey to create things and put them
out in the world for people to enjoy and hopefully help. So that's the next step
for me - open source, writer, builder. I have a few ideas I've been sitting on
for a while now and I am very fortunate that I get to focus on them 100%. It's too
early to tell precisely how this things will unfold, but I'm excited for this
next chapter. I'll be sharing my experiences along the way so stay tuned!
