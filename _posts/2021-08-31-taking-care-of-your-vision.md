Over the past several months, I've had a epic battle with losing my
vision. Earlier this year in the spring, I noticed I was having small amounts of
eye strain after long periods of computer work. Then I would take it easy and
limit screen time and eventually the eye strain would go away and I would return
back to normal. However, over time, the eye strain would continue and eventually
it would get so bad, I couldn't even look at a television without feeling like
my eyes were going to pop out of my head. <!--more-->

After a year+ of heavy screen use forced upon us by the pandemic, longer hours
working, video games, binge watching television night after night, it's no
wonder my eyes had reached their breaking point.

Without my eyes, I was rendered virtually useless and so I wanted to share a few
tips in this post that eventually helped my eyes get back on track.


#### Limit screen time

I wasn't given much choice on this one. My body forced me to give up screen time
or else live with what seemed like endless headaches. So no more waking up and
checking my phone for emails, Reddit, or Hacker news.

There is a nice side effect of this - I now have more free time and feel more
present with the world. It's been nice not always being "connected" with the
internet. It only took my eyes bleeding to break me from this bad habit of
always checking my phone.

#### Proper lighting

It goes without saying that working in the dark with only light from the screen
is not good over long periods of time. There are a few more factors than just
turning on the lights that made a difference for me. Reducing screen glare can
also alleviate your eyes of having to work extra hard to see what's beyond the
glare. This meant moving my screen so that I'm facing the sun or window.

Another tip that's really
helped me is having a light behind the screen. Similar to [Bias
Lighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_lighting), having light behind
screens can help reduce perceived brightness. My desk faces a wall so I
searched for "backlight" on Amazon and found a good set of LED lights that I
installed on the back side of my monitor. I could feel the difference right
away as my eyes felt more relaxed.


#### Have your eye's checked

This is an obvious choice, but it's important that you work with your eye doctor
to get the right option for you. The first prescription I received didn't last
long and I was feeling eye strain almost a week after receiving my new pair of
glasses. I went back to the doctor and had them re-checked. Sure enough, the
prescription changed and had to wait another three weeks for a new pair.

This go around, I also decided to try [progressive
lenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_lens) that increase in strength
when looking down like reading a book and decrease strength when looking
up. They're meant to accommodate natural use of the eyes. Unfortunately for me,
my eyes dart around all the time on my big computer screen when sitting at the desk, I would look up
and down the computer screen all the time so something was always out of
focus. Back to the eye doctor again.

What finally worked for me are "Computer" glasses with my exact
prescription. The computer glasses give me a 5 feet range of clear vision and is
more suitable for my desk setup and how I work. Thank goodness the long battle
with my eyes is over...for now.
