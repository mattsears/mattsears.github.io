Writing multi-threaded code is hard. If you've ever done concurrent programming,
you'll *probably* agree. Clojure offers a compelling alternative to
traditional object-oriented approaches to programming and has garnered much
attention from the Ruby community because of it's elegant design that lets you
get right to the essence of a problem.<!--more-->

#### What is Clojure?

Simply put, Clojure is a functional programming language for the Java Virtual
Machine with several powerful features for building concurrent applications. In
addition, Clojure is fast, robust, and a powerful general-purpose programming
language. A dialect of Lisp, Clojure embraces traditional code-as-data
philosophy and a powerful macro system, plus some syntactic sugar tailored to
Java.

Now that [version 1.0](http://clojure.blogspot.com/2009/05/clojure-10.html) is out and Stuart Halloway's new book [Programming Clojure](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure) just dropped, I've rounded up some of the best articles and tutorials on Clojure to you get you up to speed quickly.
