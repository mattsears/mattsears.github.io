At [Littlelines](http://littlelines.com), we have to write a lot of code under
strict time constraints. We work in small teams which means that
writing clean and concise code is a necessity. When a Ruby library comes along
that makes code easier to grasp in a hurry, test, and maintain - we use it. Here
are some gems we have in our toolbox: <!--more-->

#### [Formtastic](http://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic)

If you're developing wep apps, more than likely it will include html forms.
Forms can be a time-drain, not to mention very boring to build. Formtastic
provides a more concise way of generating form views and includes inline error
messages and is semantically rich.

#### [Resource  Controller](http://github.com/giraffesoft/resource_controller)

Resource Controller hides away the RESTful controller boiler plate code and make
your controllers skinny. Skinny controllers help you to consolidate your
business logic into one place, thus saves time on maintenance and testing.

#### [Search Logic](http://github.com/binarylogic/searchlogic)

Finding data can get messy. Sometimes we run into situations where we are
concatenating strings to build SQL statements and this can lead to
bugs. Searchlogic works by creating a number of named scopes that can be called
on any ActiveRecord model. The best part, you can dynamically call scopes on
associated classes and Searchlogic will take care of creating the necessary
joins for you.

#### [Alchemist](http://github.com/toastyapps/alchemist)

Occasionally, we work on projects dealing with conversions.  Alchemist is a Ruby
library that does conversions for you and thus making your code more readable
and easier to maintain. For example:

Instead of:

    miles = 8 * 1609.344 # converting meters to miles

We can write:

    8.meters.to.miles

Alchemist includes a staggering array of conversions including distance, mass, volume, and more.

#### [andand](http://andand.rubyforge.org/)

andand is a handy gem that allows allows natural method chaining for methods that can return nil. This saves a lot of boilerplate code and improves readability. For example:

Instead of:

    @body = (article = Article.find_by_title('test')) && article.body

We can write this:

    @body = Article.find_by_title('test').andand.body

This will call find on the Article class and sends 'body' if the result is not nil. In addition, our methods are guarded from NoMethodErrors is the result is nil.
