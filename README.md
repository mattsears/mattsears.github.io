#### Here is a recent job post that we can draw some article ideas on:

https://apply.workable.com/basecamp/j/847AB75F32/

Here are some of the things you might work on:

Review how we can minimize testing bottlenecks at the end of the Shape Up cycle
together with the team lead. Should we run staggered cycles as we add more
teams? Bring on more contractors for the spiky times? Something third?

Help a team trade concessions to ensure we hammer the scope of a new feature
enough to fit within the six-week cycle. Develop the intellectual muscles and
confidence for new programmers to propose scope changes that provide better
bargains.

Oversee the hiring process as we seek to add another 12-15 programmers
in 2022. Ensure we continue to attract a broad set of candidates, run a fair and
transparent process, and involve team leads primarily to spend their time
evaluating competence and fit, not the process.

Help prioritize a batch of bug fixes to fit a three-week slot in the upcoming
cycle. Work with support and testing to ensure we fix the most important issues
rather than just what's at the top of the list.

Assist a team lead in running a performance improvement plan for a coworker
who's struggling to meet expectations.

Help us think through when we might want to split off security as its own team
and function. Setup that team and expectations when/if we do.

Organize the work to ensure that our continuous integration process consistently
runs in less than 4 minutes. Track when we fail our own goals, find out what
needs to be done to fix it.
